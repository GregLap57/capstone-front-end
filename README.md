Caribbean Essence Website

Caribbean Essence is a website that showcases the rich culture and cuisine of the Caribbean islands. The website has four main pages: Home, Menu, Order, and Gallery.

Front-end

The front-end of the website is built using React and a library called Toastify, which provides easy-to-use notifications. The React Router library is used for navigation between pages.

Back-end

The back-end of the website is built using Node.js and the Express framework. The data is stored in four JSON files and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are set up using routes. The CORS library is used for handling cross-origin requests.

Testing the Website

To test the website, you will need to download the following dependencies:

Front-end axios react react-dom react-router-dom react-scripts react-toastify sass

Back-end cors dotenv express fs json nodemon uuid

Once you have downloaded the dependencies, you can start the website by running the following command in the project directory:
